1. This dataset contains a crustal velocity model (Vp and Vp/Vs models of depth range = 0-40km, relative to mean sea level) for the greater Permian basin.

2. The models were developed using tomographic inversion with data of regional and teleseismic earthquakes.

3. File name fpr Vp model = PB3D_Vp.tab ; see the first line for explanation of each column

4. File name for Vp/Vs model = PB3D_VpVsratio.tab ; see the first line for explanation of each column

5. Citation of this velocity model:
